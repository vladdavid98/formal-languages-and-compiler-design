Laboratory Assignment 5: Use of LEX and YACC

You may use any version (LEX or FLEX)

1) Write a LEX specification containing the regular expressions corresponding to your language specification.

2) Use Lex in order to obtain a scanner. Test for the same input as 
in lab 1.


You may use any parser generator (yacc-bison, LLgen or other)

3) Write a specification file containing the production rules corresponding to the language specification.

4) Then, use the parser generator, and test it on the input as in Lab 3.
