     Lab Assignment no. 4-  Parsing

One assignment for a team of 2 students!

    One of the following parsing methods will be chosen:
            	1.a. recursive descendent
		1.b. ll(1)
	        1.c. lr(0)
	        1.d. lr(1)

The representation of the parsing tree will be:
             2.a. table (using father and sibling relation)
             2.b. productions string
             2.c. derivations string


The assignment is divided in the following phases:

    STEP 1: perform the parsing of an input sequence

     Input: - a context free grammar (the example from course)
            - an input sequence
     Output: the parsing tree corresponding to the input sequence or a message in case the sequence is not accepted.

Remark: Verify if the parsing method can be applied


    STEP 2: performs the parsing for a program written in your language (lab. 1)

      Input: PIF + minilanguage grammar
      Output: parsing tree corresponding to the program or a message for errors (error diagnose where it is the case)

If the grammar does not satisfy the conditions of the parsing algorithm, consult your teacher!
